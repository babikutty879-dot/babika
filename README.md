🧠 How It Works

1. The app initializes with default “bot” messages.


2. When the user types a message and presses “Send”, it’s added to the chat window.


3. The chat auto-scrolls to show the latest message.


4. The logic can easily be extended to connect with a backend or chatbot API (like OpenAI or Firebase).
